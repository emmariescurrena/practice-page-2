    <h1>Focus ability</h1>
    <img class="mainimage" src="../images/focus2.jpg" alt="focus"
    style="object-position: 0% 25%;">
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Focus ability refers to the capacity of be able to channel all your
      energy and attention on a single task, stimulus, etc.
    </p>  
    <h3>Why is important?</h3>
    <p>
      The human brain reachs his maximum processing potential, among other
      things, by doing one thing at the time. Suppose that a brain has 100
      of power. Being able to focus secures you to have in hands at least 90
      of that power. But if your attention is fractionated, suppose, in 2
      tasks, the power of the tasks added doesn't reach the 70. Summarizing,
      we have more power in hands and we also optimize our energy, because
      both scenarios, supposing that you are trying to focus in the second
      case, spend the same energy.
    </p>
    <h2>How to improve it</h2>
    <h3>First of all: Measure your focus</h3>

    style="object-position: 0% 70%;">
    <p>
      Knowing your capacities to stay focus gives
      you a <strong>reference</strong> to track the progress
      in this journey. This can be done by starting to work
      in something that needs you to stay focus to
      understand and doesn't bore you. Start a
      cronometer and stop it when try to notice you
      are losing focus. This is our reference. If you
      are not secure of the fairness of this test, test
      you again with the same task and with some
      others to have more references to see and reveal
      if your lack of focus is with a particular task.
    </p>
    <h3>Silence your phone</h3>
    <img class="secimage" src="../images/mute-phone.jpg" alt="mute-phone"
    style="object-position: 0% 30%;">
    <p>
      For some people this advice is the end of the world. This
      device is the best <strong>focus-breaker</strong> existent. If you think
      that someone can call you for an emergency, first think
      which is gonna call you before calling someone more. And
      if you are waiting a call, silence only the notifications.
      For those who can't stop to look at the phone inclusive being
      silenced, is recommended to move the phone to another room or
      give it to another person. For this people, who wander about
      other things while trying focusing, you can try to have a 
      notebook to write that things to work them later.
    </p>
    <h3>Care about your body's health</h3>
    <img class="secimage" src="../images/health3.jpg" alt="health"

    <p>
      There is a ton of research about the correlation between your
      physical and your mental health. The best thing for the brain is just
      <strong>move</strong>. If you don't trust me, try it for yourself. And
      I'm not talking only about going to the gym or running. Playing a sport,
      walking, swimming are included. the point is to, again,
      <strong>move</strong>. You're gonna feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About nutrition, I summarize three main things to accomplish a 
      pretty healthy one:
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid ultraprocessed food and use pure ingredients.</li>
        <li>Have a balance between proteins, carbohydrates and fats.</li>
        <li>Include veggies in some form in every meal.</li>
        <li>Don't fill your stomach at maximum.</li>
        <li>Vary between boiling, baking, friyng and vaporing</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      importance.
    </p>
    <h3>Work with fixed time chunks and rest</h3>
    <img class="secimage" src="../images/time-chunking.jpg" alt="time-chunking"
    style="object-position: 0% 0%;">
    <p>
      Scheduling your time to work excempts you from know when to stop 
      working, giving you a plus of focus and knowing when to rest. For
      example, if your focus lasts 25 mins, work 25 min and rest for, like, 5.
      After some chunks, in this case let say 4, take a longer break, like 20
      minutes. The rest between chunks and the longer break are proportional
      to the duration of the chunks. The important thing is to find work
      chunks according to your focus strength.
    </p>
    <h2>Reminder</h2>
    <p>
      This are a lots of things to consider and to implement in your life.
      So don't be afraid of starting, but, on the other side, don't be too
      enthusiastic. Better start with one of this and slowly incoporate the
      others. I recommend going from top to bottom, because the top advices,
      at least for me, have more impact than the below advices. All is up to
      you.
